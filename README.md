Summary:

In this lab I created a cloud server calculator and a java client application that connected to the server.
Everything worked out fine and I didn't ran into any big problems.
The only issue I had was that the browser could not find the "start-script" from the Procfile,
but that was quickly fixed by defining index.js as "start-script" in the package.json-file.
